Native, system-only version of https://github.com/wg/scrypt

  Stripped down version of wg/scrypt that only supports jni and only loads shared libs from the system path.

Building Native Implementation

  A native shared library for the current platform may be built by running GNU
  make. The Makefile attempts to detect the runtime platform and JDK location,
  but in some cases one or more of the following variables should be passed
  to make:

  TARGET    - target operating system, use "android" to build for Android
  SSE2      - use the SSE2 optimized scrypt implementation when set
  JAVA_HOME - base directory of a Java 6+ JDK
  NDK_ROOT  - base directory of Android NDK

Placing shared libs

  Shared libs are loaded from System.getProperty("java.library.path")

    OSX: cp target/libscrypt.dylib /System/Library/Java/Extensions/
    Linux: cp target/libscrypt.so /usr/lib64/
